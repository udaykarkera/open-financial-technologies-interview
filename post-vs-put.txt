URL:
    POST        /openmoney/users        Create a new users
    PUT         /openmoney/users/1      Update the user information identified by "id"

Practise:
    POST        Always use POST for CREATE operations.
    PUT         Always use PUT for UPDATE operations.

Idempotent
    POST        NOT idempotent      If you request N times, N number of resources will be created
    PUT         Is idempotent       If you request N times, that should be equivalent to single resource modification.
